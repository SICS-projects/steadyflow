For developers

While CMake lets you do out-of-source builds anywhere, and it should install
correctly in any case, the code that's there to allow running from the source
tree makes some assumptions at the moment. It is therefore preferable to
build with these commands:

mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make

To build Steadyflow, you will need development packages for:
  * CMake >= 2.6 (cmake)
  * Vala >= 0.16 (valac)
  * GTK+ >= 3.0 (libgtk-3-dev)
  * GLib >= 2.30 (libglib2.0-dev)
  * libgee (libgee-dev)
  * libnotify >= 0.7 (libnotify-dev)
  * Optionally: libappindicator (libappindicator-dev) for Ubuntu indicator

The structure of the source tree is as follows:

cmake
 - Project-unspecific cmake scripts, plus a copy of intltool-extract
data
 - Data files (Glade, icons, setting schemas)
po
 - Translations
scripts
 - All three scripts assume they are run from the source root.
   - updatepo - update translations
   - seed - create a new class file
         syntax: seed Steadyflow{|.Core|.UI} ClassName
vapi
 - Required VAPI files, including AppConfig.vapi - a Vala mapping for config.h
Steadyflow.Core
 - Reusable non-GUI dependent classes
Steadyflow.UI
 - Reusable GUI classes
Steadyflow
 - Main application logic

CMakeLists.txt: main CMake script
sources.cmake: list of source .vala files to include in the build
install.cmake: rules for make install
